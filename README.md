# Analyze A/B Test Results
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
*  consider you need to make the decision just based on all the data provided. If you want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%
